		"description": "Welcome to the Reply.io API guide. Let's get you integrated smoothly!\n\n# API Endpoint\n\nOur platform utilizes the endpoint: `api.reply.io` We offer two versions of our API: `V1` and `V2`, each with its unique functionalities. You're free to employ both versions in tandem if desired.\n\n# Authentication\n\nTo gain access to the API:\n\n1. Login into your Reply Account\n    \n2. Navigate to `Settings`\n    \n3. Find and copy your API key under `API Key`.\n    \n\n🔑 **API Key Example:** `AKp2BbuyfS-ugPMkBmd3sg2`\n\n# Constructing API Requests:\n\nAll your requests will start with either:\n\n- `https://api.reply.io/v1/` or\n    \n- `https://api.reply.io/v2/`\n    \n\n# Response Codes\n\n- 200 - All good! Request was successful.\n    \n- 201 - Success! A new item was created.\n    \n- 400 - Uh-oh! There's an issue with your input parameter. Check the response for more information.\n    \n- 401 - User not found. This means no users match the API key provided.\n    \n- 403 - Access denied. The API key you've provided doesn't have the required permissions for the resource you're trying to access.\n    \n- 404 - Resource not found. Double-check your URL or the resource identifier. More details can be found in the response.\n    \n- 500 - Our bad! There's an internal server error. We've been notified and will get on it ASAP. Check the response for any extra information\n    \n\n# Rate Limits\n\nTo ensure optimal performance and equitable usage for all users, the Reply API has set rate limits:\n\n- **Monthly API Calls**: Each Reply user is allowed up to 15,000 API calls every month.\n    \n- **API Throttling**: There is no general throttling, but certain requests may be subject to throttling, refer to the specific request in this guide for more details.\n    \n\nPlease ensure to stay within these limits to avoid any disruptions in service.",

					"description": "# Description:\n\nReply webhooks provide a seamless way to receive notifications about events within the Reply platform. With webhooks, you can set up your server to be alerted whenever specific events occur. These webhooks are triggered whenever one or more of the subscribed events take place.\n\nWhen Reply's events are triggered, we send an HTTP POST payload to the URL you've configured for your webhook subscription. These payloads are delivered in JSON format and contain both common fields and event-specific data.\n\n# Webhook Types:\n\nReply supports several webhook types, each corresponding to a specific event:\n\n- **email_replied**: Triggered when a prospect replies to an email or when a prospect's status is set to 'Replied.'\n- **reply_categorized**: Triggered when a reply is categorized with a new inbox category. If an uncategorized category is assigned, the webhook will not be triggered.\n- **email_sent**: Triggered when a new email is sent, either as the first step or as a follow-up.\n- **email_opened**: Triggered when a person opens your email.\n- **contact_opted_out**: Triggered when a person opts out of further communication.\n- **contact_finished**: Triggered when a prospect finishes a sequence with various finish reasons.\n- **contact_called**: Triggered when a cloud call is made or logged with call details.\n- **email_link_clicked**: Triggered when a user clicks on a link within an email sent as part of a sequence.\n    \n\n# Rate Limits:\n\nWe are currently limiting the number of webhooks to 30 per user regardless of the webhook type.\n\n# Retry policy:\n\nThe webhook didn't pass if any HTTP status except 200-299 is returned.  \nWe retry webhooks with 429, 500, 502 HTTP statuses and whenever a timeout occurs.  \nIf webhook retries are unsuccessful, the event is considered as failed.\n\n# Disabling webhooks:\n\nTo avoid performance issues, when Reply tries to call an unresponsive URL, we suggest to turn off webhooks.  \nThe webhook is disabled when after the first failed attempt:\n\n- not a single event passed during 48 hours, and if\n- the consecutive number of 5 webhook calls failed (if more than 48 hours are needed to have 5 webhook calls)\n    \n\nAn event is considered failed if 100% of its retries are failed.\n\n# Webhook payload\n\nWebhooks deliver responses in JSON format. Each webhook payload consists of a common part and some fields specific to the webhook.\n\n# Common webhook fields:\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| contact fields | object | Set of fields to describe a contact |\n| id | integer | Contact's ID |\n| email | string | Contact's email |\n| domain | string | Contact's domain |\n| first name | string | Contact's first name |\n| last name | string | Contact's last name |\n| full name | string | Contact's full name |\n| title | string | Contact's title |\n| company | string | Contact's company |\n| phone | string | Contact's phone |\n| city | string | Contact's city |\n| state | string | Contact's state |\n| country | string | Contact's country |\n| time zone id | string | Contact's current time zone |\n| linkedin profile url | string | Contact's LinkedIn URL |\n| company size | integer | Contact's current company size |\n| industry | string | Contact's current company industry |\n| linkedin sales navigator | string | Contact's Sales Navigator URL |\n| linkedin recruiter | string | Contact's LinkedIn Recruiter URL |\n| sequence fields | object | Set of fields to describe the sequence |\n| id | integer | Sequence ID |\n| step number | integer | Number of the step in the sequence |\n| contact custom fields | object | Custom fields for the contact |\n| name: value | string | Pair of custom name and value for the contact |\n| event | object | Set of fields for the event |\n| date | datetime | Sequence creation date in UTC |\n| id | guid | Event connected with the webhook ID |\n\n# Email_Replied webhook specific fields:\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| reply_message_id | integer | ID of the reply message |\n| reply_date | DateTime | Date of the reply in UTC |\n| sent_email_id | integer | ID of the sent message to which the reply was received |\n| email_account_id | integer | Account ID of the sender |\n| reply_message_url | string | URL for downloading the message in eml format |\n| reason | integer | How the replied status was obtained.
